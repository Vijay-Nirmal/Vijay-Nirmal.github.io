# About Me

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br><br>

I am a 23 year Software Engineer in H&R Block. where I mostly work on core/advance part of .Net/Azure to implement robust framework that will be used my multiple teams. As a whole I am a full stack developer using AspNetCore for Backend, UI using Angular, Databse using both SQL and NoSQL, and have strong knowledge in deployment using Containerization/Kubernetes, also have worked on service mesh using Istio.

Contrary to the general reception, I was actually a fan of the Windows phone. It was what inspired me to learn to code as I felt the need to fill the gap of apps on the Windows Phone app store. Later, I started contributing to the Windows Community Toolkit open-source project and became a core member of the team. I have always had an affinity for Microsoft, and working for Microsoft would be a dream come true.
